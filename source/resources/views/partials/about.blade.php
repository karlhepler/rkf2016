    <h3>About the festival</h3>
    <h4 class="blue">Our mission is to celebrate the traditions of passing on musical heritage in the mountain state.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The Robin Kessinger Festival is pleased to announce the 2016 festival, to be held in conjunction with the Heritage Farm Museum and Village's "Way Back Weekend" on June 3 &amp; 4.  In addition to Friday and Saturday concerts, the WV State Flatpick Guitar Contest on Saturday, and traditional music workshops Saturday morning, the Heritage Farm venue offers a peek back in time for the whole family. Interact with life as it was in Appalachia from thee 1800’s through the early 1900’s in award winning exhibits that include over 20 buildings, as well as enjoy the music – which will be scattered through the farm as well. And don’t forget to visit the Mountain Men’s camp to see how our first settlers lived.</p>
    <p>We promote and encourage people to support West Virginia’s musical heritage as well as expose them to a variety of musical styles. Our hope is that everyone who attends our festival will go home with fond memories of the celebration of music, the beauty of our state, and the good times with old and new friends.</p>
