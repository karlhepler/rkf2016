    bio: `
        Wayne Henderson's top-notch finger-picking is a source of great pleasure and pride to his friends,
        family and neighbors in Grayson County, Virginia. His guitar playing has also been enjoyed at
        Carnegie Hall, in three national tours of Masters of the Steel-String Guitar, and in seven nations in Asia.
        <br><br>
        In addition to his reputation as a guitarist, Henderson is a luthier of great renown. He is a recipient
        of a 1995 National Heritage Award presented by the National Endowment for the Arts. He produces about
        20 instruments a year, mostly guitars; he is almost as well-known for the mandolins he has made. Good
        friend Doc Watson owned a Henderson mandolin. He said, "That Henderson mandolin is as good as any I've
        had my hands on. And that's saying a lot, because I've picked up some good ones."
        <br><br>
        Some of Henderson's instruments are intricately decorated but are most respected for their volume, tone,
        and resonance. Blues guitarist John Cephas said that Wayne Henderson "is probably the most masterful
        guitar maker in this whole United States." There is a waiting list for Henderson's guitars made up of
        the famous (and not-so-famous).
        <br><br>
        Wayne was the 2014 convocation speaker at Appalachian State University in Boone. Read about it at

        Above and beyond his great talents as a musician and luthier, Wayne Henderson is known as a "friend to everyone"
        and shares his talents and knowledge unselfishly.
        <br><br>
        The Wayne C. Henderson Music Festival and Guitar Competition was established in 1995 to express appreciation for
        this living legend. A portion of the proceeds from the Festival are placed into a scholarship fund to aid local
        young musicians in continuing their educations. Through the 2015 festival, scholarships totaled more than $137,000.

    performer: true,
    name: 'Roger Rabalais',
    image: 'roger.jpg',
    bio: `
        Growing up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he always liked music as a kid.
        Music was something that was prevalent in the Rabalais household.
        "Both of my parents loved music; they encouraged it," said Roger.
        At an early age, he began playing trumpet but would not discover the
        guitar until later on. Legends such as Elvis, The Kingston Trio,
        and the Beatles arose as Roger progressed in school. Drawing inspiration
        from their music, Roger sang in a garage band during high school.
        "It was when the Beatles came out," Roger says, "that I realized someone
        had to write these songs." His career in music began with the folk movement
        and transitioned through the Beatles era to the singers/songwriters movement
        of the seventies and eighties.
        <br><br>
        Though Roger enjoyed the musical arts, he decided to pursue a different
        career in radio production, broadcast sales, and management until he resumed
        his avocation as a singer/songwriter in the 1980s while he was living in Aspen, Colorado.
        His infatuation with the OK Corral led Roger to start writing numerous songs
        throughout the 80s and 90s about the Earps, Clantons, and Tombstone,
        which you can find on his 2012 released album Tombstone, 1881.
        <br><br>
        Roger refers to his genre as Americana, encompassing story-telling songs
        like those on Tombstone, 1881. Songs like these were his greatest writing influences.
        He credits traditional country artists, such as  Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash,
        John Prine and Guy Clark as some whom he drew from, along with the "gulf coast musings"
        of Jimmy Buffet. Roger explains, "I liked ballads that told stories." Many of Roger's
        songs are of this story-telling nature. "I'm attracted to songs that tell stories and
        believe the true nature of a ballad is a song that tells a story, unlike the smooth
        country love ballads on the radio today." Although it's hard to describe his specific style,
        Roger defines his music as an acoustically accompanied and contemporary folk style that
        emphasizes story-telling lyrics.

    bio: `
        Simple - one guitar, one mandolin, two voices. Pure - no-frills Appalachian mountain music.
        Honest - melody-rich tales told through song. Tim & Jodi Harbin have joined forces to
        create an acoustic duet with deep roots. Tim and Jodi met several years ago at the
        Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas and found a shared musical vision.
        They weave their respective musical heritages into a collaboration that speaks to history
        and tradition, while always looking forward. 
        <br><br>
        Tim is East Tennessee born and bred. This Powell, Tennessee native has been a staple of the
        Knoxville music scene for more than 30 years. Tim has showcased his talents at guitar contests
        and festivals across the southeast, but most recently is known for his work with the
        High Kotton Band and Southern Express. Tim’s guitar and singing style reflect his roots and
        influences which include Doc Watson, Norman Blake and New Grass Revival. 
        <br><br>
        Jodi is originally from Waverly Hall, Georgia, but has most recently shared her musical talents
        in Colorado and nationally with her original acoustic band, Lonesome Traveler. Jodi began playing
        music and performing at an early age as a classical pianist. She took up the mandolin about 15
        years ago and hasn’t looked back. She infuses her love of acoustic music with a diverse background
        that includes writing songs, performing in both the University of Tennessee and University of Georgia
        marching bands, and serving as a professional collaborative pianist at the University of Northern Colorado.
        Her fluid mandolin style reflects influences from Roland White, Tim O’Brien and Mike Compton.

    bio: `
        A consummate performer and stellar guitar player / multi-instrumentalist,
        Karl’s singular presence on stage is surprisingly engaging and always entertaining.
        He is truly a class act who breaks every expectation of a typical solo acoustic
        singer-songwriter. Between original works and his own take on existing songs,
        his style blurs genres, ultimately focused on the traditional mountain music of Appalachia.
        <br><br>
        Spring-boarding from the Allegheny Echoes Workshops, he has studied with and performed
        alongside some of the modern-day greats of Appalachian music including Robin Kessinger,
        Robert Shafer, Bobby Taylor, The Bing Brothers Band, The Whitetop Mountaineers, and
        The Poor Taters (to name a few). Some notable performances include Oyster Ridge Music Festival,
        The Tamarack, Richmond Folk Music Society, Shady Grove Coffeehouse, The Charleston Culture Center
        during Vandalia Gathering, and The Catan World Championship.
        <br><br>
        Incorporating the feeling and story-telling of Appalachian music community in his own music,
        which has been compared to Gordon Lightfoot, Gram Parsons, Tim O’Brien, and Gillian Welch,
        Karl is a true and modern reflection of the melodies passed down through generations.
        His songs weave complex emotion through metaphor in a subtle dance around the stories they tell,
        and his voice fits perfectly between his masterful rhythmic chord stylings and his powerful and
        expressive flat-picking. He is truly one of the best undiscovered modern folk performers today.
